//A simple Java program appears below.
/*

A program starts in main(), executing the statements within main's braces { }, one at a time.
Each statement typically appears alone on a line and ends with a semicolon, as English sentences end with a period.
The int wage statement creates an integer variable named wage. The wage = 20 statement assigns wage with 20.
The print and println statements output various values.
